Step 1: Install Node.js
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which you'll use to install packages.

Step 2: Create Your Project
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
Initialize a new Node.js project: Run npm init -y in your terminal. This creates a package.json file.
Install WebSocket: Run npm install ws to install the WebSocket library.
Step 3: Set Up the WebSocket Server

Create a file named server.js in your project directory and add the following code:


This server listens for connections on port 8080 and broadcasts any received messages from one client (browser) to all other connected clients.


Step 4: Run Your Server
Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run node server.js to start the WebSocket server.
Open two browser windows and navigate to your index.html file to act as the two players. Depending on your setup, you might need to serve your HTML through a web server. For a simple server, you can install http-server via npm and run it in your project directory.
